- (REQUIRED) OpenGL Renderer so I can follow along with learnopengl
- (REQUIRED) Engine be a DLL
- (THINK) thirdparty libraries resolution. precompiled, to compile.
- (REQUIRED) Setup GLFW
- (REQUIRED) Use CMake and Premake
- (OPTIONAL) Enable Unity build to test if it works. Maybe it will be problematic with the DLL approach.
